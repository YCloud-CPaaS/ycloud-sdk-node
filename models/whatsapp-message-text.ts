     * By default, WhatsApp recognizes URLs and makes them clickable, but you can also include a preview box with more information about the link.

The majority of the time, the receiver will see a URL they can click on when you send an URL, set preview_url to true, and provide a body object with a http or https link. URL previews are only rendered after one of the following has happened: - The business has sent a message template to the user. - The user initiates a conversation with a \"click to chat\" link. - The user adds the business phone number to their address book and initiates a conversation. Default: `false`.
